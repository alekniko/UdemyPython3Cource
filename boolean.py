# Python comes with Booleans (with predefined True and False displays that are basically just the integers 1 and 0).
# It also has a placeholder object called None. Let's walk through a few quick examples of Booleans
# (we will dive deeper into them later in this course).
b = None
print(1 < 2)
print(1 > 2)
print(1 == 1)
print(type(b))
